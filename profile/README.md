# Outrun Introduction

**Outrun** is a leading **DeFi** solution on Blast, dedicated to pioneering the next generation of decentralized finance and the Web3 industry, empowering users with control over their assets. Currently, Outrun offers four products: **Outstake**, **Outswap**, **FFLaunch**, and **Memeverse**.

## Outstake 
Outstake is a LSDFi protocol built entirely around Blast's **native yield**. It's a leading native yield staking solution that allows users to control the native yields generated by their assets. Additionally, users' tokens can maintain liquidity and be utilized across a range of DeFi applications, thereby earning additional rewards. Outstake introduces a new type of **non-USD stablecoin** called REY (RUY), which is pegged to ETH's (USDB) native yield. The protocol adopts an innovative economic model, offering long-term stakers higher yields compared to traditional staking protocols. The assets supported by Outstake form the foundational support of the Outrun ecosystem, providing a stable foundation for the entire ecosystem. Specifically, the working principles of Outstake are as follows:

+ **Blast Native Yield Features**: Outstake fully leverages Blast's native yield features, allowing users to earn higher returns when staking their assets.

+ **Stablecoin REY(RUY) Pegged to ETH(USDB) Staking Yields**: REY(RUY) is a new non-USD stablecoin whose value is directly tied to ETH(USDB) staking yields. This means that as ETH(USDB) staking yields fluctuate, the value of REY(RUY) adjusts accordingly, providing users with a more stable asset that is connected to market dynamics.

+ **Innovative Economic Model**: Outstake employs a new economic model designed specifically for long-term stakers. This model not only considers short-term gains but also focuses on long-term returns, encouraging users to stake for extended periods. The aim of this model is to deliver higher returns compared to traditional staking protocols.

Through these features, Outstake aims to offer a more attractive option for stakers, especially those seeking stable and high returns over a long period.

## Outswap
Outswap's first version, known as **Outrun AMM**, is built on Uniswap v2 and includes several Blast (Layer 2)-based local improvements. The main features are as follows:

+ **Using orETH and orUSD as Intermediary Tokens**: Outrun AMM introduces orETH and orUSD as intermediary tokens in trading pairs. This design allows Outstake to capture native yields generated by OutswapV1, increasing the protocol's revenue.

+ **Separation of Liquidity and Market-Making Fees**: Outrun AMM improves the management of market-making fees by separating liquidity from fee collection. This allows users to collect fees without removing liquidity, providing greater flexibility and convenience for liquidity providers.

+ **New Fee Tiers**: All Uniswap v2 pools have a fixed swap fee of 0.3%, which results in a lack of flexibility for LPs (liquidity providers) who cannot seek different fee structures based on the assets they provide to the exchange. Outrun AMM will introduce new fee tiers for pool creators, allowing them to build different trading pools for various types of assets when launching pools on Outrun AMM.

+ **On-chain Referral Bonus Engine**: Outrun AMM is currently the only automated market maker on the market integrated with a referral bonus engine. We have redesigned the underlying code and opened the referral bonus engine to everyone, thereby increasing the composability of the protocol. The rewards for the referral bonus come from the protocol fees and do not harm the interests of LPs. At the same time, this attracts more transactions, bringing higher income to LPs.

## FFLaunch

FFLaunch is the first "**Risk-Free**" LaunchPad that adheres to **fair and free** launch standards. Inspired by the ethos of **inscription**, it allows investors to acquire project tokens for free by staking and locking ETH or USDB liquidity. Meanwhile, project teams can raise funds from liquidity provider fees during the locking period. FFLaunch provides an open interface to support custom launch logic that does not violate fairness and free principles. This model is more equitable and investor-friendly, while enabling project teams to raise sufficient funds.

## Memeverse

Memeverse is a Memecoin launchpad built on the concept of **FFLaunch**. Unlike FFLaunch, Memeverse has no entry barriers and removes the customizable token generator interface. It uses a universal token template to create Memecoins, allowing users to complete all deployments with a one-click process using our website UI, **without requiring any programming knowledge**. Memecoin creators can receive ongoing transaction fee income and gas refunds to support the operation and development of practical features within the Memecoin community.

These products are not independent of each other, they complement and closely intertwine in functionality, linking **liquidity staking derivatives**, **decentralized exchanges**, **next-generation token financing methods**, and **Memecoins**. Through their design and **interoperability**, they construct a **complete closed-loop** Outrun ecosystem, providing users with diverse DeFi and Web3 experiences.
