# Introduce

**Outrun** is committed to becoming a pioneer in the next-generation DeFi and Web3 industries, **driving the expansion of Web3's native value into the real world**. Through innovative yield tokenization, decentralized stablecoin, fair launch models, and community sustainable construction, it unlocks DeFi yields with **higher capital efficiency** for users, while leveraging Memecoin as a pivot to **promote the widespread adoption of DAOs in Web3 and the real world**. The Outrun ecosystem currently comprises five major modules—OutStake, OutSwap, FFLaunch, Memeverse, and POL Lend—encompassing **Yield tokenization, Stablecoin, DEX, Risk-free community financing new paradigms, and Memecoin × DeFi × DAO**.

* **OutStake** is a **yield tokenization** and **stablecoin** module built around **yield-bearing assets**. It employs a novel mathematical model to construct **perpetual** YT and UPT stablecoin, resolving the liquidity fragmentation issues in existing yield tokenization protocols (such as **Pendle**). At the same time, it **captures the native yields** from idle liquidity within the ecosystem, providing stakers with additional yields, thereby greatly enhancing capital efficiency and composability.

* **OutSwap**'s first version, known as **Outrun AMM**, is built on the constant product AMM and includes several innovative improvements. The most important among them is that Outrun AMM integrates the first **real-time settlement** native **on-chain referral commission engine**, allowing anyone to develop their own referral services based on Outrun AMM to guide liquidity and earn commissions.

* **FFLaunch** is the first "**risk-free**" community financing paradigm under the standard of **fair** and **free**. It avoids the risk of project teams rug-pulling (**protecting investors** and **providing free project tokens**), prevents project teams and investors from using the secondary market as an exit for liquidity (**protecting the secondary market**), and enables project teams to obtain **sustainable funding streams** to accelerate development, achieving a **triple-win** outcome.

* **Memeverse** is an omni-chain **community consensus launcher** pivoted on **Memecoin**. By integrating **Memecoin Staking** and **Memecoin DAO Governance**, it transforms Memecoin from a mere speculative asset into a **community asset** with **sustainable value**, while accelerating the iteration and evolution of DAOs as a novel mode of human collaboration. At the same time, it is built on the principles of FFLaunch, enabling users to participate in the Memecoin ecosystem with "**lower risk or even risk-free**," thereby meeting the needs of users with **diverse risk preferences**—even the most conservative investors can **safely** engage in Memecoin ecosystem development, rather than it becoming a battlefield for a tiny elite of PVP experts.

* **POL Lend** is a special **CDP (Collateralized Debt Position)** module within the Outrun ecosystem. Unlike **MakerDAO**, it enables users to conduct "**uncollateralized**" borrowing by **paying only interest** when participating in FFLaunch and Memeverse, providing users with **leverage without liquidation risk**, thereby greatly enhancing the liquidity and capital efficiency of the Outrun ecosystem.

# Multi Module Combination

**Outrun** has built a unique, multi-module closed-loop **Super App Ecosystem** that addresses pain points in various scenarios through modular design. Each module serves a specific function, yet achieves interoperability through data and resource sharing, creating a **synergistic effect** that drives the continuous operation of the **growth flywheel**. This design significantly enhances the ecosystem's **network effects** and **capital efficiency**.

Let's take a look at the **module architecture diagram** of the Outrun ecosystem:

* **OutStake** is the **yield tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure** of the Outrun ecosystem, serving as the foundational module. UPT Stablecoin, as the **lifeblood** of the Outrun ecosystem, flows through all modules, connecting the entire system.

* **OutSwap** is the **liquidity hub** of the Outrun ecosystem, providing efficient liquidity support for assets issued by OutStake, FFLaunch, and Memeverse, acting as the **heart** of the ecosystem.

* **FFLaunch** and **Memeverse** are the **traffic entry points** and **asset issuance platforms** of the Outrun ecosystem, located at the top layer, are the areas with the highest user activity, and serve as **powerful engines** driving the growth flywheel.

* **POL Lend** is a specialized **CDP (Collateralized Debt Position)** module, distinct from **MakerDAO**. By integrating the [**POL token**](fflaunch/proof-of-liquidity-token/) with **yield tokenization engine**, it enables users to conduct "**uncollateralized**" borrowing by **paying only interest**, thereby allowing them to autonomously "**create efficient capital out of thin air**" like a central bank, greatly enhancing the liquidity and capital efficiency of the Outrun ecosystem.

# Why do we need multi modules?

* Staking protocols' revenue relies on commissions, leading to **low profit margins** and **limited growth potential**, Must create **diversified revenue** through **ecosystem synergy**.

* OutStake is also a **stablecoin** module. The key to stablecoins is **adoption** for settlements or pricing, not becoming unsustainable **dollar-yield schemes** reliant on points or token incentives.

* In the Outrun ecosystem, modules **aren't isolated but tightly linked**, building multi-layered **growth flywheels** through composability and interoperability. This drives efficient capital flows, greatly boosting **network effect**s and **capital efficiency**.

* Outrun believes Web3's **endgame** isn't a flood of infrastructure, but **Super App** — so building a modular, scalable super-app ecosystem is key to **long-term success**.

# RoadMap

Outrun has undergone multiple rounds of **small-scale closed betas**, iterating through several versions, and is now the **final version** before the public testnet.
