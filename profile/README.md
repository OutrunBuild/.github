# Outrun Brief Introduction

**Outrun** is committed to becoming a **pioneer** in the next-generation **DeFi** and **Web3** industries. Currently, it consists of four modules: **OutStake**, **OutSwap**, **FFLaunch** and **Memeverse**. It encompasses **yield tokenization**, **liquid staking derivatives**, **decentralized exchanges**, **next-generation token financing paradigm** and **Memecoin Staking**.

## OutStake 
**OutStake** is a protocol entirely built around **yield-bearing tokens**, introducing the first **non-USD stablecoin model** tied to **yield rates**. Compared to other yield token protocols in the market, such as **Pendle**, OutStake offers **greater flexibility, enhanced composability**, and provides **higher returns along with multiple sources of income**. The assets supported by OutStake form the foundational support for the Outrun ecosystem, providing a stable base for the entire system. Specifically, OutStake operates as follows:

* **A New Staking Model Based on Yield-bearing Tokens:** OutStake adopts a unique design that allows users to control the yields generated by their assets. Through OutStake, users can mint Principal Tokens **(PT)** by staking their assets, thereby unlocking liquidity for their staked assets and utilizing these tokens across a range of DeFi applications.
* **Interest-Rate-Linked Stablecoin (YT)**: The value of an interest-rate-linked stablecoin is directly tied to interest rates. The economic model built around it provides stakers with higher income and a variety of revenue sources. It is highly composable, allowing developers to create new products around it, thereby enriching the Outrun ecosystem.
* **Universal asset principal token (UPT)**: UPT is a omnichain universal principal token supported by **LayerZero**, enabling it to be seamlessly transferred across different blockchains to amplify its network effect. The Principal Tokens (PT) of **the same underlying asset type** can be converted into UPT (such as PT-Stone, PT-stETH, PT-rETH, etc.). This allows the UPT liquidity of different yield-bearing tokens under the same underlying asset type to be **shared**, thereby enhancing the combinability of UPT and reducing the difficulty of liquidity accumulation for yield-bearing tokens.
* **Position Option Tokens(POT):** These option tokens represent the right to redeem the **yield-bearing token** at the end of its lock-up period. This option allows users to trade for a fixed interest rate without trading the **PT** itself, thereby enhancing capital efficiency.

## OutSwap
**OutSwap**'s first version, known as **Outrun AMM**, is built on classic AMM and includes several innovative improvements. The main features are as follows:

* **Capture Native Yield ([**Blast L2**](https://docs.blast.io/about-blast) Only):** On Blast L2, the Outrun AMM adds extra logic to handle the native yields generated by WETH and USDB. All native yield will be distributed to liquidity providers based on their LP shares, ensuring fair allocation and increasing the profitability for market makers. The yield is issued in the form of [**SY(Standardized Yield)**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/sy.md).
* **Separation of Liquidity and Market-Making Fees**: Outrun AMM improves the management of market-making fees by separating liquidity from fee collection. This allows users to collect fees without removing liquidity, providing greater flexibility and convenience for liquidity providers.
* **New Fee Tiers**: All **classic AMM** pools have a fixed swap fee of **0.3%**, which results in a lack of flexibility for LPs (liquidity providers) who cannot seek different fee structures based on the assets they provide to the exchange. Outrun AMM will introduce new fee tiers for pool creators, allowing them to build different trading pools for various types of assets when launching pools on Outrun AMM.
* **Referral Commission Engine**: Outrun AMM is currently the only automated market maker on the market integrated with a referral commission engine. We have redesigned the underlying code and opened the referral commission engine to everyone, thereby increasing the composability of the protocol. The rewards for the referral bonus come from the protocol fees and do not harm the interests of LPs. At the same time, this attracts more transactions, bringing higher income to LPs.

## FFLaunch

**FFLaunch** is the first "**Risk-Free**" LaunchPad that adheres to **fair and free** launch standards. Investors can acquire tokens by staking and locking **yield-bearing tokens**. The **PT** generated from staking these **yield-bearing tokens** will be paired with a **reserved portion of tokens** in the contract to provide liquidity on the **Outrun AMM**. The liquidity provider **(LP)** tokens will be locked for a certain period, and corresponding **tradable liquidity proof tokens** are minted. Project teams can raise funds from **liquidity provider fees** during the locking period.Once the lock period expires, investors can withdraw their locked LP which consist of their **PT** and the reserved tokens by burning the liquidity proof tokens (or sell them earlier if preferred). This effectively allows users to obtain these tokens for **free** while continuously participating in the overall liquidity-building process of the project. FFLaunch provides an open interface to support **custom launch logic** that does not violate fairness and free principles. This model is **more equitable and investor-friendly**, while enabling project teams to raise sufficient funds.

**As an Investor Participating in FFLaunch**

* **Obtaining Tokens for Free:** After the liquidity lock-up period expires, investors can redeem the liquidity they added before. This is basically equivalent to obtaining tokens for free. Even if the project fails, investors can still retrieve most of their initial investments, thus obtaining ultra-low-risk returns.
* **Avoiding Pump and Dump by Insiders:** When the tokens are listed, all the tokens are in the liquidity pool and no one has obtained tokens in advance. Moreover, during the liquidity lock-up period, new tokens cannot be minted or released, preventing the project team from using the initial users as the liquidity for their exit.
* **Continuous Earnings:** During the lock-up period, staked Yield-bearing Token will generate yields, distributed in the form of YieldToken(YT), providing investors with additional earnings.
* **Rug Pull Prevention:** The FFLaunch model prevents project teams from absconding with raised funds, ensuring fairer token distribution and protecting investors' rights.
* **Tradeable Liquidity Proof:** Investors mint tradeable liquidity proof tokens when they lock liquidity. They can trade these tokens at any time, thereby managing their risk while their liquidity remains locked.

**As a Project Team Participating in FFLaunch**

* **Fair Fundraising:** By providing liquidity and a lock-up mechanism, project teams can ensure that the funds raised are more equitable and transparent.
* **Continuous Fund Flow:** Project teams can receive ongoing funding support from transaction fees generated during the LP lock-up period, incentivizing them to continuously improve and maintain the project.
* **Enhanced Market Liquidity:** Since tokens are obtained for free, more users are attracted to participate, increasing the depth of the liquidity pool and enhancing market liquidity.
* **Market Attention:** FFLaunch offers an innovative issuance model that can attract more market attention, especially from investors who are skeptical of traditional ICO/IDO models.
* **Flexibility and Innovation:** Project teams can use **ITokenGenerator** interface (**subject to review**) to customize their launch logic, meeting specific needs and enhancing the project's uniqueness and appeal.
* **User Stickiness:** Since investors hold shares of the liquidity locked during the FFLaunch genesis period, each genesis user is considered a shareholder during the liquidity lock period. This ensures that users continuously monitor their investments and potentially provide exposure opportunities for the project, significantly reducing operational obstacles for the project's cold start.
* **Meme-Based Operations:** Given the **Memecoin** attributes of FFLaunch tokens, project teams can engage with and communicate with users in unique ways through meme-based operations.

## Memeverse

**Memeverse** is an omnichain **Memecoin Launchpad** and **Memecoin Staking (Restaking)** protocol built based on the concept of **FFLaunch**. Compared with FFLaunch, Memeverse has no entry barriers at all. Memeverse has removed the customizable token generator interface and uses a universal token template to create Memecoins. Users **don't need any programming knowledge** and can complete all the **omnichain** deployments with just one click using our website UI. Creators of Memecoins can obtain the **UPT portion** of the continuous transaction fee income to support the operation of the Memecoin community and the development of practical functions. And each Memecoin has an ERC4626 **Memeverse vault**, which allows Memecoins to be staked into the vault to obtain staking rewards. The rewards come from the **Memecoin portion** of the transaction fee income as well as other potential revenues.

Currently, there are many Memecoins launch methods in the market, but these methods are quite **primitive and lack innovation**. They also face **significant risks**, such as **insider trading** (Some platforms even promote **“immediate purchase within the same transaction as the token issuance”** as a major selling point.), **Rug Pulls**, and a **strong element of gambling**, without creating any new value. Compared to its competitors in the market, Memeverse offers the following advantages:

* **Unique Symbol Ensures Scarcity**: The symbol of each Memecoin is unique throughout the **omnichain Memeverse**, which ensures the scarcity in naming. This can help Memecoins generated by **news trading**, for example, **have stronger recognition and appeal in the market**.
* **FFLaunch Style Launch**: Memeverse launches through **FFLaunch** to avoid common risks such as **fraud, insider trading, and rug pulls** in traditional Memecoin issuance. This method ensures that all participants start on an equal footing, reducing their risk and providing a relatively safe way to participate.
* **Capturing Staking Yields from OutStake**: Memeverse allows users to stake yield-bearing tokens to mint UPTs and simultaneously obtain the staking yields generated by OutStake. This improves the utilization rate of funds, enabling investors to participate in the activities of Memecoins while also engaging in **DeFi** staking. This mechanism not only attracts novice investors to participate in DeFi but also brings more potential users to the DeFi ecosystem.
* **Memecoin Staking and Restaking**: Memecoin holders can stake their memecoins into the vault to mint **yield-bearing tokens** of memecoins that comply with the ERC4626 standard. The value of these tokens will accumulate over time. Meanwhile, they can also stake and lock the yield-bearing tokens of memecoins again in OutStake, thus obtaining **more yields and composability**.
* **Continuous Financial Support**: Memecoin creators can obtain continuous financial support from the **market-making earnings** generated by the locked liquidity. These forms of income provide certain economic support and incentives for the continuous operation of the Memecoin community or for the development of practical functions for Memecoins.
* **Memeverse Referral Service**: Memeverse allows users to generate **one-click direct referral links** for Memecoin. Clicking the link will take users directly to the Memecoin details page. When the referred users trade using the link, the referrer will receive a **commission** from the protocol fees.
* **PPP Low-Risk Attracts More Capital Participation**: Compared with the severe **PVP** sentiment among the current Memecoins on the market, participating in the genesis of Memeverse entails lower risks. Thanks to the features of **FFLaunch** and the existence of the **Memecoin vault**, even in extreme circumstances, investors can preserve the vast majority of their investments, and the risks are **predictable**. This low-risk characteristic attracts funds with a lower risk preference to invest in Memecoins, providing more sufficient liquidity for the Memecoins issued through Memeverse, which lays a solid foundation for the development of Memecoins.
* **Community Support and Viral Spread from Genesis Users**: Every participant in the Memecoin genesis launch becomes a strong advocate for the Memecoin community. They **not only hold tokens but also possess liquidity shares locked during the genesis period**, making them shareholders during this time. This fundamental drive encourages them to promote the Memecoin they participated in during the liquidity locking period. This mechanism helps reduce operational barriers during the Memecoin community's cold start phase and promotes **rapid viral adoption**.

In summary, Memeverse provides **innovative issuance methods, staking reward mechanisms, economic support measures, and community-driven forces**, offering new perspectives and solutions for Memecoin development. These advantages not only enhance the market competitiveness of Memecoins but also have the potential to drive the entire industry towards **greater transparency, security, and sustainability**.

These products are not independent of each other, they complement and closely intertwine in functionality, linking **yield tokenization**, **liquidity staking derivatives**, **decentralized exchanges**, **next-generation token financing paradigm**, and **Memecoin Staking**. Through their design and **interoperability**, they construct a **complete closed-loop** Outrun ecosystem, providing users with diverse DeFi and Web3 experiences.
