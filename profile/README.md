# Outrun Introduction

**Outrun** is a leading **DeFi** solution on Blast, dedicated to pioneering the next generation of decentralized finance and the Web3 industry, empowering users with control over their assets. Currently, Outrun offers four products: **Outstake**, **Outswap**, **FFLaunch**, and **Memeverse**.

## Outstake 
Outstake is a LSDFi protocol built entirely around Blast's **native yield**. It's a leading native yield staking solution that allows users to control the native yields generated by their assets. Additionally, users' tokens can maintain liquidity and be utilized across a range of DeFi applications, thereby earning additional rewards. Outstake introduces a new type of **non-USD stablecoin** called REY (RUY), which is pegged to ETH's (USDB) native yield. The protocol adopts an innovative economic model, offering long-term stakers higher yields compared to traditional staking protocols. The assets supported by Outstake form the foundational support of the Outrun ecosystem, providing a stable foundation for the entire ecosystem. Specifically, the working principles of Outstake are as follows:

+ **Blast Native Yield Features**: Outstake fully leverages Blast's native yield features, allowing users to earn higher returns when staking their assets.

+ **Stablecoin REY(RUY) Pegged to ETH(USDB) Staking Yields**: REY(RUY) is a new non-USD stablecoin whose value is directly tied to ETH(USDB) staking yields. This means that as ETH(USDB) staking yields fluctuate, the value of REY(RUY) adjusts accordingly, providing users with a more stable asset that is connected to market dynamics.

+ **Innovative Economic Model**: Outstake employs a new economic model designed specifically for long-term stakers. This model not only considers short-term gains but also focuses on long-term returns, encouraging users to stake for extended periods. The aim of this model is to deliver higher returns compared to traditional staking protocols.

Through these features, Outstake aims to offer a more attractive option for stakers, especially those seeking stable and high returns over a long period.

## Outswap
Outswap's first version, known as **Outrun AMM**, is built on Uniswap v2 and includes several Blast (Layer 2)-based local improvements. The main features are as follows:

+ **Using orETH and orUSD as Intermediary Tokens**: Outrun AMM introduces orETH and orUSD as intermediary tokens in trading pairs. This design allows Outstake to capture native yields generated by Outrun AMM, increasing the protocol's revenue.

+ **Separation of Liquidity and Market-Making Fees**: Outrun AMM improves the management of market-making fees by separating liquidity from fee collection. This allows users to collect fees without removing liquidity, providing greater flexibility and convenience for liquidity providers.

+ **New Fee Tiers**: All Uniswap v2 pools have a fixed swap fee of 0.3%, which results in a lack of flexibility for LPs (liquidity providers) who cannot seek different fee structures based on the assets they provide to the exchange. Outrun AMM will introduce new fee tiers for pool creators, allowing them to build different trading pools for various types of assets when launching pools on Outrun AMM.

+ **On-chain Referral Bonus Engine**: Outrun AMM is currently the only automated market maker on the market integrated with a referral bonus engine. We have redesigned the underlying code and opened the referral bonus engine to everyone, thereby increasing the composability of the protocol. The rewards for the referral bonus come from the protocol fees and do not harm the interests of LPs. At the same time, this attracts more transactions, bringing higher income to LPs.

## FFLaunch

FFLaunch is the first "**Risk-Free**" LaunchPad that adheres to **fair and free** launch standards. Inspired by the ethos of **inscription**, it allows investors to acquire project tokens for free by staking and locking ETH or USDB liquidity and corresponding tradable liquidity proof tokens are minted. Investors still benefit from native yields generated by staked assets. Meanwhile, project teams can raise funds from liquidity provider fees during the locking period. Upon expiration of the LP lock, investors can withdraw their locked LP by burning the liquidity proof tokens (or sell them earlier if preferred). For investors, this equates to acquiring project tokens at no cost, while the project team gains continuous revenue flow. FFLaunch provides an open interface to support custom launch logic that does not violate fairness and free principles. This model is more equitable and investor-friendly, while enabling project teams to raise sufficient funds.

**As an Investor Participating in FFLaunch**

+ **Free Tokens**: Investors can mint tokens by staking ETH or USDB, without needing to purchase tokens directly, making the acquisition cost extremely low, effectively getting tokens for free.

+ **Low-Risk Returns**: Investors' staked funds can be redeemed after the lock-up period, meaning that even if the project fails, investors can reclaim most of their initial investment, achieving very low-risk returns.

+ **Continuous Earnings**: During the lock-up period, staked ETH or USDB will generate native returns, distributed in the form of REY and RUY YieldTokens, providing investors with additional earnings.

+ **Rug Pull Prevention**: The FFLaunch model prevents project teams from absconding with raised funds, ensuring fairer token distribution and protecting investors' rights.

+ **Tradeable Liquidity Proof**: Investors mint tradeable liquidity proof tokens when they lock liquidity. They can trade these tokens at any time, thereby managing their risk while their liquidity remains locked.

**As a Project Team Participating in FFLaunch**

+ **Fair Fundraising**: By providing liquidity and a lock-up mechanism, project teams can ensure that the funds raised are more equitable and transparent.

+ **Continuous Cash Flow**: Project teams can receive ongoing funding support from transaction fees generated during the LP lock-up period, incentivizing them to continuously improve and maintain the project.

+ **Enhanced Market Liquidity**: Since tokens are obtained for free, more users are attracted to participate, increasing the depth of the liquidity pool and enhancing market liquidity.
  
+ **Market Attention**: FFLaunch offers an innovative issuance model that can attract more market attention, especially from investors who are skeptical of traditional ICO/IDO models.
  
+ **Flexibility and Innovation**: Project teams can use ITokenGenerator interface (subject to review) to customize their launch logic, meeting specific needs and enhancing the project's uniqueness and appeal.
  
+ **User Stickiness**: Since investors hold shares of the liquidity locked during the FFLaunch genesis period, each genesis user is considered a shareholder during the liquidity lock period. This ensures that users continuously monitor their investments and potentially provide exposure opportunities for the project, significantly reducing operational obstacles for the project's cold start.
  
+ **Meme-Based Operations**: Given the meme attributes of FFLaunch tokens, project teams can engage with and communicate with users in unique ways through meme-based operations.

## Memeverse

Memeverse is a Memecoin launchpad built on the concept of **FFLaunch**. Unlike FFLaunch, Memeverse has no entry barriers and removes the customizable token generator interface. It uses a universal token template to create Memecoins, allowing users to complete all deployments with a one-click process using our website UI, **without requiring any programming knowledge**. Memecoin creators can receive ongoing transaction fee income and gas refunds to support the operation and development of practical features within the Memecoin community.

Currently, there are many ways to issue Memecoins on the market, but these methods are often primitive and lack innovation. They also pose significant risks such as insider trading, rug pulls and has a serious gambling nature, creating no new value. In contrast to competitors in the market, Memeverse offers the following advantages:

+ **Unique Symbol Ensures Scarcity**: The symbol of each Memecoin is unique during the liquidity lockup phase, ensuring naming scarcity for a certain period. This helps Memecoin have stronger recognition and appeal in the market.

+ **FFLaunch Style Launch**: Memeverse launches through FFLaunch to avoid common risks such as fraud, insider trading, and rug pulls in traditional Memecoin issuance. This approach ensures all participants start on an equal footing, providing a nearly risk-free entry into Memecoin at nearly cost-free.

+ **Capturing Staking Rewards from Outstake**: Memeverse allows users to capture staking yields generated by Outstake through the minting of Memecoin, which enhances capital efficiency. This mechanism not only attracts novice investors to participate in DeFi but also brings more potential users to the DeFi ecosystem.

+ **Continuous Financial Support and Gas Fee Refund Returns**: Memecoin creators can receive ongoing financial support from trading fees generated by locked liquidity and enjoy a rebate of all gas fees incurred on that Memecoin (See Blast feature). These forms of revenue provide economic support and incentives for the continued operation of the Memecoin community or for developing utility functions for Memecoin.

+ **Memeverse Referral Service**: Memeverse allows users to generate one-click direct referral links for Memecoin. Clicking the link will take users directly to the Memecoin details page. When the referred users trade using the link, the referrer will receive a commission from the protocol fees.

+ **Memeverse Reserve Fund**: The Memeverse Reserve Fund can provide price support, and anyone can use the funds in the reserve fund. Additionally, during continuous repurchases, a portion of Memecoin will be permanently destroyed, and the reserve fund will continuously grow in size when Memecoin is sold.

+ **Low-Risk Appeal for Increased Participation**: Memeverse's low-risk characteristics attract capital with lower risk preferences, providing ample liquidity for Memecoins issued through Memeverse. This lays a solid foundation for the future development of Memecoins.

+ **Community Support and Viral Spread from Genesis Users**: Every participant in the Memecoin genesis launch becomes a strong advocate for the Memecoin community. They not only hold tokens but also possess liquidity shares locked during the genesis period, making them shareholders during this time. This fundamental drive encourages them to promote the Memecoin they participated in during the liquidity locking period. This mechanism helps reduce operational barriers during the Memecoin community's cold start phase and promotes rapid viral adoption.

Memeverse provides innovative issuance methods, staking reward mechanisms, economic support measures, and community-driven forces, offering new perspectives and solutions for Memecoin development. These advantages not only enhance the market competitiveness of Memecoins but also have the potential to drive the entire industry towards greater transparency, security, and sustainability.

These products are not independent of each other, they complement and closely intertwine in functionality, linking **liquidity staking derivatives**, **decentralized exchanges**, **next-generation token financing methods**, and **Memecoins**. Through their design and **interoperability**, they construct a **complete closed-loop** Outrun ecosystem, providing users with diverse DeFi and Web3 experiences.
