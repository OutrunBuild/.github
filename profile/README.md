# Outrun
**Outrun** is a leading **DeFi** solution on Blast, dedicated to pioneering the next generation of decentralized finance and the Web3 industry, empowering users with control over their assets. Currently, Outrun offers four products: **Outstake**, **Outswap**, **FFLaunch**, and **Memeverse**.

+ **Outstake** is a LSDFi protocol built entirely around Blast's **native yield**, introducing a new type of **non-USD stablecoin** called REY (RUY), which is pegged to ETH's (USDB) native yield. The protocol adopts an innovative economic model, offering long-term stakers higher yields compared to traditional staking protocols. The assets supported by Outstake form the foundational support of the Outrun ecosystem, providing a stable foundation for the entire ecosystem.

+ **Outswap**'s first version, known as **Outrun AMM**, is built on UniswapV2 and localized for Blast. It introduces orETH and orUSD as intermediary tokens and enhances liquidity provider fee management. Key features include using orETH and orUSD as intermediary tokens to capture native yields and separating liquidity provider fees from liquidity, allowing users to independently claim LP fees without removing liquidity. Additionally, Outrun AMM integrates **the first on-chain referral bonus engine**, enabling anyone to develop their own referral services on Outrun AMM to earn commissions.

+ **FFLaunch** is the first "**Risk-Free**" LaunchPad that adheres to **fair and free** launch standards. Inspired by the ethos of **inscription**, it allows investors to acquire project tokens for free by staking and locking ETH or USDB liquidity. Meanwhile, project teams can raise funds from liquidity provider fees during the locking period. FFLaunch provides an open interface to support custom launch logic that does not violate fairness and free principles. This model is more equitable and investor-friendly, while enabling project teams to raise sufficient funds.

+ **Memeverse** is a Memecoin launchpad built on the concept of **FFLaunch**. Unlike FFLaunch, Memeverse has no entry barriers and removes the customizable token generator interface. It uses a universal token template to create Memecoins, allowing users to complete all deployments with a one-click process using our website UI, **without requiring any programming knowledge**. Memecoin creators can receive ongoing transaction fee income and gas refunds to support the operation and development of practical features within the Memecoin community.

These products are not independent of each other, they complement and closely intertwine in functionality, linking **liquidity staking derivatives**, **decentralized exchanges**, **next-generation token financing methods**, and **Memecoins**. Through their design and **interoperability**, they construct a **complete closed-loop** Outrun ecosystem, providing users with diverse DeFi and Web3 experiences.
